<li>The World is constantly generating new data at an astonishing rate. 
</li>
<li>According to <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>, every day in 2012, 2.5EB (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte">Exabytes</a>) of new data were generated. In this project, we'll look at where this data is coming from, see how it can be user, identify your contribution and try analysing some large data sets for ourselves. 
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some organisations store large amounts of data, which will need processing. Google, for instance. 
</li>
<li>Read <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/63/">this article</a> from xkcd.com. 
</li>
<li>Each of us has a digital footprint, which we leave every day. The data we generate can be used as part of big data analysis projects to provide information to the Government to help assign NHS funding, or to help supermarkets decide how much milk to order. 
</li>
<li>Consider the NHS. Across the country, millions of people are treated every year. Each time a patient is treated, an electronic record of the problem, diagnosis and treatment it stored.

<li>Write a short report called, 'My Digital Day'. Ensure your work is spell-checked and uses good grammar throughout!
</li>
<li>Starting with when you wake up on a weekday morning, write about every digital interaction you have (some are more subtle than others), and try to identify how this could be useful to someone working on big data.
</li>
<li>For example, as your bus drives into School, traffic cameras by the side of the road will monitor the number of vehicles on the road, and their average speed. This data is collected and used by traffic services (as seen on Google maps, Sat-Nav systems, radio station reports, AA traffic&#x2026;) to alert motorists to any potential problems so they can avoid them. Over the long-term, the Government agency responsible for the UK road network (called the Highways Agency) will use this data from all over the UK to decide where roads need to be made larger and identify where accidents commonly occur (to reduce speed limits or install speed cameras). 
</li>
<li>You could also consider: What services do you use on your 'phone? What if you use a supermarket? What happens in tutor time? The Chill? The library? Do you use a service like NetFlix or Amazon Prime? What about Instagram? What if you had a doctor/dentist appointment? 
</li>
<li><b>Silver:</b> A brief report, outlining 3 different pieces of collected data. 
</li>
<li><b>Gold:</b> A more detailed report, outlining practical ways the data could be used as part of a big data analysis. 
</li>
<li><b>Platinum:</b> A comprehensive report, outlining numerous interactions and the ways in which the data could be used by various parties.
